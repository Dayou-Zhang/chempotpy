This file records the steps need to be done to add a potential
Y.S. Updated on Oct 8, 2023

=============If the system exist:
1. Go into the folder corresponds to the system
2. Modify __init__.py, and add potentials
3. If the potential is multi-state surface:
   3.1. Add the surface to "====Systems Involve Multi-State Surfaces====" section in chempotpy/__init__.py
   3.2. Add the surface to "====Systems Involve Multi-State Surfaces====" section in docs/Manual.txt
4. If the potential has DPEM:
   4.1. adds corresponding DPEM surface
   4.2. Add the _DPEM name into the "multi_state_list" in chempotpy/__init__.py
5. If the potential reads parameters from a file:
   5.1. put that parameter file into the same folder where your potential locates, i.e. chempotpy/system/
   5.2. add the surface to "requires_read_file_list" in chempotpy/__init__.py
   5.3. add the surface to "List_of_surface_need_path" in chempotpy/meta_chempotpy.script 
6. Add the surface entries to "====Full List of Surface Names for Each System===" in chempotpy/__init__.py
   remember to update the last line "Total Number of Surfaces [last index]:" 
7. Similar modification as done in step 6 to docs/List_of_potentials.txt, and docs/Manual.txt
8. Update HISTORY.txt

=============If the system does not exist:
1. Create a new folder with system name in chempotpy/, and go into the folder corresponds to the system
2. Create __init__.py, and add potentials
3. Add the new system name to following places:
   3.1. Update "List_of_system" in chempotpy/meta_chempotpy.script
   3.2. Update "====Alphabetical List of Systems====" in BOTH def manual() and def system() in chempotpy/__init__.py
   3.3. Update "====Full List of Surface Names for Each System===" in chempotpy/__init__.py
   3.4. Update "====Alphabetical List of Systems====" in docs/Manual.txt
   3.5. Update "====Full List of Surface Names for Each System===" in both docs/List_of_potentials.txt, and docs/Manual.txt
   3.6. Update "SYSTEMS" in Makefile
4. If the potential is multi-state surface:
   4.1. Add the surface to "====Systems Involve Multi-State Surfaces====" section in chempotpy/__init__.py
   4.2. Add the surface to "====Systems Involve Multi-State Surfaces====" section in docs/Manual.txt
5. If the potential has DPEM:
   5.1. adds corresponding DPEM surface
   5.2. Add the _DPEM name into the "multi_state_list" in chempotpy/__init__.py
6. If the potential reads parameters from a file:
   6.1. put that parameter file into the same folder where your potential locates, i.e. chempotpy/system/
   6.2. add the surface to "requires_read_file_list" in chempotpy/__init__.py
   6.3. add the surface to "List_of_surface_need_path" in chempotpy/meta_chempotpy.script
7. Add the surface entries to "====Full List of Surface Names for Each System===" in chempotpy/__init__.py
   remember to update the last line "Total Number of Surfaces [last index]:"
8. Similar modification as done in step 6 to docs/List_of_potentials.txt, and docs/Manual.txt
9. Update HISTORY.txt
